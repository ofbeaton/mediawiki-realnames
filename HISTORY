See [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG) for the current releases.

== 0.5.1 (2019-02-04) ==

bugfix:
* added PersonalUrls hook to wfLoadExtension method. Does not work with Timeless skin. (thanks <mhausi>)

== 0.5.0 (2019-02-04) ==

features:
* you can now load extension using wfLoadExtension( 'Realnames' ); 

testing:
* 1.32.0, 1.31.1 (LTS)

== 0.4.0 (2019-02-03) ==

features:
* new $wgRealnamesStyles: dash-reverse, paren-append, paren-reverse
* all $wgRealnamesStyles now include all user text in the link (create custom style to restore previous behaviour)
* $wgRealnamesLinkStyle now defaults to paren-reverse (was reverse)

bugfix:

* fix RecentChanges/AllUsers/etc which added more html to links (thanks Syserr0r)

testing:

== 0.3.2 (2019-01-30) ==

notes:
* documentation update

== 0.3.1 (2011-12-25) ==

bugfix:
* custom namespace regex (thanks Cweiske)
* STRICT error with STATIC (thanks Vgold)

notes:
* removed contrib-agreement, consensus in discussions indicate it's
 uneeded to remain BSD in shared environment.
* some progress is being made into core-features for name display, expect
 some future version to support things like sorting based on realnames (thanks Daniel Friesen)
* version 0.3 misreported version as 0.2.1, now 0.3.1 (oops, again)

issues:
* Consensus is that performance could be an issue using current methods. I am currently working
 on a 2-pass version of the extension to address these issues that will be released as soon as
 it is ready.

testing:
* svn trunk 2011-12-26, stable 1.18.0, 1.17.1, 1.16.5, 1.15.5

== 0.3 (2011-11-05) ==

features:
* you can opt-out of replacements using $wgRealnamesReplacements (thanks Salquint)
* we now have smarts in the form of not displaying "Marry - Marry" text
* you can change "smart" features like above using $wgRealnamesSmart

bugfix:
* version 0.2 misreported version as 0.1.1, now 0.3
* now tied into main debugging framework
* a missing return statement was causing titles in append style to get garbled

notes:
* switched to a more permissive and correct bsd-2-clause license agreement for commits
* added more metadata files

issues:
* I continue to be concerned with performance on large recentchanges/history since my initial
 post about it on 2011-09-19. After receiving a few code reviews recently (finally!) the main
 feedback has been that there may indeed be scalability problems with using newFromName. In my
 original post (see extension talk page) I proposed two solutions, but haven't heard from anyone
 experiencing problems yet. I think I may implement a two-pass as described in the next feature
 version, however it will make the code significantly more complex. I'll hold off on extending
 those two specific pages until it's confirmed a two-pass isn't enough.

testing:
* svn trunk 2011-11-05, 1.18.0beta1, 1.17.0, 1.16.5, 1.15.5

== 0.2 (2011-09-22) ==

features:
* replaces username in personnal url bar (where you click login top right vector)
* allows custom namespace detection $wgRealnamesNamespaces
* adds support for Extension:Configure (undoc at release)

bugfix:
* i18n links User: namespaces (thanks Nilsy)
* support for upcoming 1.18 gendered namespaces
* title handling for pre 1.16 wiki's
* custom namespace names

testing:
* trunk 2011-09-22 stable 1.17.0, 1.16.0, 1.15.5

== 0.1.1 (2011-09-17) ==

bugfix:
* eliminated use of create_function due speed implications (thanks Dantman)
* changed user caching to realname cache for a smaller memory footprint (thanks Dantman)
* moved debug handling into class and uses $wgRequest, can expand later for 1.18+ (thanks Dantman)
* license change to BSD, cc is not recommended for software (says them) (thanks Dantman)
* fixed author link (backported to 0.1, thanks Dantman)

issues:
* It may be that this extension is slow on RecentChanges and History pages. If so,
  I have a solution, but I'd rather not introduce more code if I don't have to.
  If you experience noticable slowdowns on these pages please let me know at
  olivier dot beaton at gmail dot com

== 0.1 (2011-09-17) ==

initial tested pages:
* Special:ListUsers
* old and new Special:RecentChanges
* Special:Search of the User: space
* History of page
* Revisions list of page
* Revision view of page
* Revision Compare
* Page header + html title (limited)
* Should integrate into any page where user links are found

issues:
* Always destructive of User: text, new config in future release?
* improve bare detection on users with spaces or underscores in names (article titles and html title)
