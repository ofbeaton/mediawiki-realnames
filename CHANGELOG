This is the changelog for the Realnames extension.

https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:Realnames

== 0.6.1 (2019-02-09) ==
**FEEDBACK NEEDED TO KEEP CONFIGS, SEE NOTE FOR 0.6.0 **

bugfix:
* incremented version display

== 0.6.0 (2019-02-09) ==
**FEEDBACK NEEDED TO KEEP CONFIGS, SEE NOTE**

features:
* to keep custom styles, new configuration settings for two error states had to be added
* When user has no realname: $wgRealnamesLinkStyleNoRealname, $wgRealnamesBareStyleNoRealname
* when username and realname are same: $wgRealnamesLinkStyleSameName, $wgRealnamesBareStyleSameName

bugfix:
* when no realname, display standard format

breaking:
* removed support for now-archived Extension:Configure

note:
* this extension may suffer from too many options, especially as a result of supporting custom styles.
  If you use any option other than $wgRealnamesLinkStyle, I want to hear from you! If I don't hear from
  anyone I will assume nobody cares about the options, and I can significantly simplify the testing of the
  extension down to just to one configuration parameter, $wgRealnamesLinkStyle and remove the rest.
